Welcome to greed's documentation! This documentation is intended to be a quick guide to use greed: our symbolic execution engine for EVM smart contract binaries.

If greed makes you think of [angr](https://github.com/angr), that is because we are indeed from the same research group ([UCSB SecLab](https://seclab.cs.ucsb.edu/)). 
Some of the folks developing greed are also angr's contributor, thus, many of the choices in this project are inspired by angr.
